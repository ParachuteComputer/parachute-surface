/**
 * Service-worker bootstrap gating for the Notes UI bundle.
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 *
 *   notes-ui 0.1.1 introduced runtime mount detection — the same built
 *   `dist/` works at any mount path (`/notes/`, `/surface/notes/`,
 *   `/surface/<custom-slug>/`). Asset URLs, the React Router basename, and
 *   the OAuth redirect URI all rebase at runtime via `detectMountBase()`.
 *
 *   But the service worker and PWA manifest are baked at *build time*.
 *   The manifest's `start_url`/`scope` and the SW's precache manifest
 *   (every `/notes/index.html`, `/notes/assets/...` entry) are hard
 *   `/notes/`-scoped in the default build. When the same bundle gets
 *   mounted at `/surface/notes/`, the React app loads and routes work — but
 *   then `useRegisterSW()` registers the SW *with the page's current
 *   scope* (`/surface/notes/`), and the SW immediately starts intercepting
 *   every fetch under that scope. The precache table doesn't contain
 *   `/surface/notes/...` entries; navigations fall through to workbox's
 *   navigation route which serves `/notes/index.html` (HTML) for a
 *   request that the importing browser expected to be a JS module or a
 *   JSON manifest.
 *
 *   Result (Aaron's report 2026-05-23):
 *     - workbox throws `non-precached-url :: /notes/index.html`
 *     - browser logs `Failed to load module script: Expected
 *       JavaScript-or-Wasm module, got "text/html"`
 *     - manifest fetch fails JSON parse
 *     - OAuth callback navigation breaks because the SW intercepts the
 *       fetch and returns the wrong document
 *
 *   The right fix is mount-aware build-time PWA assets, but that needs
 *   a parachute-surface manifest-rewrite hook + multi-scope SW generation —
 *   non-trivial work. The immediate fix is to gate registration: if the
 *   runtime mount doesn't match the build-time vite base, don't
 *   register the SW at all, and unregister any stale registration left
 *   over from a previous version that didn't gate.
 *
 *   PWA "Add to Home Screen" therefore remains a build-time-pinned
 *   feature (already acknowledged in 0.1.1's CHANGELOG). Operators who
 *   want PWA install at a non-default mount must build with
 *   `VITE_BASE_PATH=/surface/<name>`. In-browser use works at any mount
 *   from the default bundle, no SW interference.

/**
 * The mount path the current bundle was built for. Trimmed of trailing
 * slash to match `detectMountBase()`'s no-trailing-slash contract.
 *
 * `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` reflects Vite's `base` config option at
 * build time. The current `vite.config.ts` sets `base: ""` for relative
 * asset URLs, in which case Vite still surfaces the canonical mount via
 * the `VITE_BASE_PATH` env arg through the manifest's `start_url` /
 * `scope`. We mirror that with our own env var read so the gate
 * compares against the same path the PWA manifest baked in.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. `import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_PATH` — explicit override (matches
 *      `vite.config.ts`'s `basePath` variable).
 *   2. `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` — Vite's own resolved base, used when
 *      no override is provided.
 *   3. `/notes/` — the historical daemon default.

 * The shape we're cleaning up after: a user on 0.1.1 or earlier installed
 * Notes via parachute-surface at `/surface/notes/`, the bundle auto-registered
 * the SW (build-time-scoped to `/notes/` via `vite.config.ts`'s `basePath`)
 * at `/surface/notes/`, and the SW now intercepts every fetch under
 * `/surface/notes/` with a precache table built for `/notes/`. Result: HTML
 * served for JS-module requests, MIME errors, broken OAuth callbacks.
 *
 * We unregister any SW whose normalised scope-pathname differs from the
 * runtime mount AND looks like a parachute mount we recognise
 * (`/notes` or `/surface/<slug>`). The "looks like ours" guard keeps us
 * from clobbering an unrelated SW that happens to be registered on the
 * same origin.
 *
 * Operators auto-recover on next page load: the stale SW unregisters,
 * the next reload is served fresh, and `shouldRegisterServiceWorker()`
 * declines to re-register at the wrong mount.
 *
 * @returns the number of registrations unregistered (for logging + tests).
