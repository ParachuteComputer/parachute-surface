/**
 * Notes-side OAuth/vault types.
 *
 * Phase 2 of the notes-migration-to-app arc (parachute-app#6, design doc
 * section 16): the OAuth + vault REST shapes that used to live here moved
 * to `@openparachute/surface-client` so other hosted apps don't re-roll them.
 * This module now re-exports the canonical types from app-client and
 * holds the small handful of Notes-specific extensions:
 *
 *   - `VaultRecord` — Notes' per-vault catalog row (URL + name + issuer +
 *     token-endpoint + client_id + scope + addedAt/lastUsedAt). Multi-
 *     vault is a Notes UX, not a general-purpose pattern; the record
 *     stays out of app-client.
 *   - `PendingOAuthState` — extends app-client's base shape with
 *     `priorHaltedVaultId`, the notes#148 round-trip channel that lets
 *     OAuthCallback clear an originally-halted vault's halt entry even
 *     when the new vault URL resolves to a different vaultIdFromUrl.
 *   - `isLegacyVaultUrl` — Notes-only guard for pre-PR-7 vault URLs (the
 *     vault project migrated `/vaults/<name>/` → `/vault/<name>/`; Notes
 *     still has old VaultRecords lying in localStorage that need to be
 *     re-added).
