/**
 * Decide whether a package should publish, for the publish-on-merge workflow.
 *
 * Ported from parachute-hub's `scripts/release-plan.ts` (hub#790 / #911 / #913).
 * Lives here rather than inline in release.yml because release logic that can
 * double-publish or silently skip deserves unit tests, and surface has six
 * npm packages that would otherwise repeat the same twenty lines of shell.
 *
 * **Tag prefixes are NOT inferred from directory basenames.** Hub can do that
 * (`packages/scope-guard` → `scope-guard-v`). Surface's npm tags are aliases
 * (`packages/surface-host` → `v`, `packages/surface-client` → `client-v`).
 * Inferring the basename would look up `surface-host-v0.3.9` — a tag that
 * does not exist — or, worse, resolve a wrong tag that does (hub#830). The
 * map in `tagPrefixFor` is the one `tag-record` pushes and the one
 * `on.push.tags` filters against. Tests pin the two to each other.
 *
 * ## What it guards against
 *
 * **Double-publishing.** Skip when the exact version already exists on npm, so
 * a re-run, a revert, or a merge that didn't bump is a no-op.
 *
 * **Silently skipping a real release.** An ambiguous registry response (5xx,
 * network failure) REFUSES rather than guessing. A false "not published"
 * double-publishes; a false "published" drops a release on the floor. Neither
 * is acceptable, so we don't pick one.
 *
 * **Publishing backwards.** This is the one the vault version of this workflow
 * doesn't have yet, and it matters as soon as PRs land in parallel: several
 * open PRs each pin their own `rc.N`, and they don't necessarily merge in
 * version order. Merging rc.6 and then rc.5 would leave the `rc` dist-tag
 * pointing at rc.5 — older than what consumers already had — so an operator
 * installing `@rc` would silently DOWNGRADE. We refuse to move a dist-tag
 * backwards. (Re-publishing an older **rc** deliberately is still possible
 * via an explicit tag push, which takes the tag branch below. A tag push of
 * a stable is refused — stables publish from `main` only.)
 *
 * **Stable that skipped rc.** 0.7.13 through 0.7.16 shipped `@latest` with
 * new code and no matching `X.Y.Z-rc.*`. Stable is a suffix-drop from an rc
 * of the same X.Y.Z, never a skip: `decidePublish` refuses a stable unless
 * npm already has that rc, and the CLI refuses again unless `git diff` from
 * the latest matching rc tag only touches version/changelog/lockfile paths.
 *
 * **Stable from `next` or a tag push.** A write token can merge to `next`
 * and can push tags; it cannot merge to `main`. So a stable version is
 * published only when the trigger is a branch push of `main`. `isTagPush`
 * still overrides the registry guards for **rc** versions (re-release, an
 * older rc, an ambiguous registry). It does not override this gate.
